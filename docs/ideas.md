### Innovative Idea
The idea is to create a workout routine planning website. Users can log in and create a custom workout routine, featuring a varying selection of exercise. Users will also be able to view a calendar which can be used to track workout days/times as designated by routines they have created. Users can upload or download another user's workout routines, and also feature routine popularity for various users. Our app could possibly be implemented with google calender.

### Important Components
* Login/logout of an account that gives access to your personal data which could be: a list of calendars, a list of routines, a list of exercises, (or any data structure not just lists). Each account will have ability to create/share calendars, routines and exercises as well as view and download from publicly available collections. We may also include functionality for users to categorize and label calendars/routines/exercises into different lists or collections. There will most likely be one type of user.

* Create: calendars (whose days contain routines), routines (which contain exercises), exercises (which could contain: the name and description of an exercise, an image or video, number of sets and reps). When creating a calendar a user may be instructed to link via Google calendar (or another pre-existing calendar software, maybe even our own handbuilt calendars) so that their desired routines can be uploaded, viewed, exported easily. When creating routines users will interact with our hand-built time table functionality that will allow users to create a pattern (daily, every other day, etc.), select timing, and duration of exercises they would like to include in a routine. Ideally there will be an "exercise bank" from which a user can select already existing exercises, they can possibly drag and drop exercises into available slots as well. The essence of our app is for users to easily visualize and plan the specifics of their unique exercise routines. Lastly when creating exercises, users can name the exercise, provide short description and include/add information about number of repetitions or sets as well as include any images/videos relevant to a given exercise.

* Upload (to the server): calendars, routines, exercises you have created

* Download (from the server): calendars, routines, exercises you or others have uploaded to the server

* Modify/Update: calendars, routines, exercises you have created or uploaded

* Delete: calendars, routines, exercises you have created or uploaded

* To add on: Import to other calenders in .ics format? Or have our own built in on the website? (Google Calendar?)
