### Innovative Idea
The idea is to create a workout routine planning website. Users can log in and create a custom workout routine, featuring a varying selection of exercies. The website will also contain a calender which can be used to track workout days/times. Users can upload or download another user's workout routines, and also feature routine popularity for various users. It could possibly be implemented with google calender.

### Important Components
* Login/logout of an account that gives access to your personal data which could be: a list of calendars, a list of routines, a list of exercises, (or any data structure not just lists)

* Create: calendars (whose days contain routines), routines (which contain exercises), exercises (which could contain: the name of an exercise, an image or video, number of sets and reps)

* Upload (to the server): calendars, routines, exercises you have created

* Download (from the server): calendars, routines, exercises you or others have uploaded to the server

* Modify/Update: calendars, routines, exercises you have created or uploaded

* Delete: calendars, routines, exercises you have created or uploaded

* To add on: Import to other calenders in .ics format? Or have our own built in on the website? (Google Calender?)
